A scientific sleep calculator that helps you find optimal bedtimes based on 90-minute sleep cycles and circadian rhythm principles.

**Live Demo:** [https://sleepcycle.tools](https://sleepcycle.tools)

## ‚ú® Features

- üïí Calculate bedtimes for 1-5 sleep cycles
- üåô Built-in 14-minute fall-asleep buffer
- üì± Fully responsive design
- üîí Privacy-focused (no cookies, anonymized analytics)
- üìä GA4 integration for aggregate usage stats

## üöÄ Quick Start

No installation needed - just visit [https://sleepcycle.tools](https://sleepcycle.tools)

For local development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sleepcycle.tools.git
cd sleepcycle.tools
# Open index.html in any modern browser
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateSleepPhases(wakeTime) {
  const phases = [];
  for(let cycles = 5; cycles >= 1; cycles--) {
    const bedtime = wakeTime - (cycles * 90 + 14) * 60000;
    phases.push({
      cycles,
      bedtime: formatTime(bedtime),
      duration: `${cycles * 1.5}h sleep`
    });
  }
  return phases;
```
